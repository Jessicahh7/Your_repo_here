The objective for this homework is to learn how you can collaborate with others on github.
To begin, you should fork this repo. 
After you have forked it, clone it into your local computer. Once you've cloned it add a file with your name. Then run through git init, git add, git commit, git remote, and finally git push. Once you have completed those steps, you should create a pull request, so that I can merge your changes into mine.
